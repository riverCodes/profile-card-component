## My process
- I started off with the mobile design. Using flexbox, it was very easy to layout all the text. I was confused about putting the profile picture element within the text container or the header container. Finally, i nested it within the header element and absolutely positioned it into place. I used flexbox on the main card to control the amount of space ratio between the header and text containers.
- I then started to work on the background images. This is the first project where I am properly using background images, and I learnt alot about the background-image property and it's other options.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt a lot about background images, multiple background images, sizing and positioning them.
- I also got to practice my flexbox for the main card.

### Useful resources

- [@ApplePieGiraffe's solution for this challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/card-component-with-3d-animation-t0NqrfqMT) - This helped me a lot with positioning the background images. Earlier, I was using px to position them, and so they moved a lot when the screen resized. After looking at this solution, I was able to refine my solution by using units like vw and vh instead.
